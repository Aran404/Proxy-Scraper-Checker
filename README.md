# Proxy-Scraper-Checker
A good proxy scraper with an alright checker that generates in a matter of seconds.

Usage:
Just run the PackageInstaller.bat then open up the python file, pick what option you want and the checker is a bit buggy but you can try it.
If the Installer doesn't work open up cmd/shell/terminal and type pip install requests and pip install colorama.
If that doesn't work try python -m pip install requests and python -m pip install colorama.
Finally if all else fails try python3 install requests and python3 install colorama.
